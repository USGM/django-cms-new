Deprecation of Old-Style Page Wizard Settings
=============================================

In this release, we introduce a new naming scheme for the Page Wizard settings
that better reflects that they effect the CMS's Page Wizards, rather than all
wizards. This will also allow future settings for different wizards with a
smaller chance of confusion or naming-collision.

This release simultaneously deprecates the old naming scheme for these settings.
Support for the old naming scheme will be dropped in version 3.5.0.

Action Required
---------------

Developers using any of the following settings in their projects should rename
them as follows at their earliest convenience. ::

    CMS_WIZARD_DEFAULT_TEMPLATE => CMS_PAGE_WIZARD_DEFAULT_TEMPLATE
    CMS_WIZARD_CONTENT_PLUGIN => CMS_PAGE_WIZARD_CONTENT_PLUGIN
    CMS_WIZARD_CONTENT_PLUGIN_BODY => CMS_PAGE_WIZARD_CONTENT_PLUGIN_BODY
    CMS_WIZARD_CONTENT_PLACEHOLDER => CMS_PAGE_WIZARD_CONTENT_PLACEHOLDER

The CMS will accept both-schemes until 3.5.0 when support for the old scheme
will be dropped. During this transition period, the CMS prefers the new-style
naming if both schemes are used in a project's settings.
